# Environmental-monitoring-with-Raspberry-Pi

## Project Description

The project demonstrates how to design an environmental monitoring system that can be scaled up or down using Raspberry Pi. Applications of such a system are very broad and include office area, greenhouse etc.

## What does it do?

The aim of the project is to provide an easy and fast way to control the environmental factors in a closed space, such as a greenhouse. This is achieved by monitoring the following:
- Temperature
- Light
- Humidity

These factors are carefully selected, so that they can give a detailed and useful information to the user through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on his PC. Since the signal from the sensors is transmitted wirelessly, the user can monitor the changes in the environment remotely and take appropriate actions if required. Thus, the system provides flexibility and regular control of the space of interest.

## Full documentation

See Wiki for full documentation on both the hardware and software parts of the project. Examples, youtube video links, operational details and additional information is also included.

### Installation 

1. Installing this project locally can be done by cloning this archive into your own Raspberry Pi:<br />  ``` git clone https://github.com/Treasurenkawu16/Environmental-monitoring-with-Raspberry-Pi.git``` <br />
2. The following directory should be first opened: ```cd QwtExample```<br />
3. To compile the code run ```qmake```, followed by ```make```.<br />


### Usage

After installations is complete, run with: <br /> ```startx \.QwtTeam18``` <br />
This will display the temperature, light and humidity measurements on the QT. 

### User Interface

Example screenshots of GUI, created and developed using QT, for monitoring the application parameters will be uploaded soon. Additional information can be found on GUI Wiki.
